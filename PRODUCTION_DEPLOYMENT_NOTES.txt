## Salesforce Record Type Verification

**IMPORTANT**: Record Type DeveloperNames may differ between sandbox and production!

### 1. Test Record Types Immediately After Deployment

GET https://[PRODUCTION_URL]/api/test/test-record-types

### 2. Verify These DeveloperNames Match Sandbox:
- **Contact Record Types:**
 - Basic Member: BasicMember
 - Cryo Member: Cryopreservation_Member
 
- **Agreement Record Types:**
 - Basic: Alcor_Membership
 - Cryo: Alcor_Cryopreservation_Membership

### 3. If Different, Update These Files:
- [ ] src/salesforce/services/memberSignup.service.js
 - Line ~45: Contact record type names
 - Line ~115: Agreement record type names
- [ ] Any other files using hardcoded record type names

### 4. Alternative: Switch to Name-Based Lookup
If record types differ, consider implementing the name-based lookup approach instead of DeveloperNames:
// Search by display name instead of DeveloperName
const recordTypeId = await getRecordTypeIdByName('Contact', 'Basic Member');

### 5. Remove Test Endpoint
- [ ] Remove /api/test/test-record-types endpoint after verification
- [ ] Remove testRoutes.js file
- [ ] Remove test route from main app file

**Note**: Keep test endpoint code in a separate branch in case you need to check other sandboxes later.
